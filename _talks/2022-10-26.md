Title: From isometric embedding to a sum of squares theorem

Abstract: Motivated by an isometric embedding problem in the graph setting, we'll discuss a sum of squares theorem for HÃ¶lder function. Given a non-negative $C^{2,2\alpha}$ function f over R, can we find a function g in C^{1,\alpha} such that f=g^2? We've found a necessary and sufficient condition for this problem, which is related to the non-zero strict local minimum points of the function f.
