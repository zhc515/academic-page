Title: Carleman type estimates and uniqueness of Cauchy problem\Abstract: Carleman estimate is a weighted estimate in proving the uniqueness of Cauchy problem. I will review some results and discuss an explicit example. In this example, we will see 1. How to get the estimate, 2. How to prove the uniqueness with this estimate.
