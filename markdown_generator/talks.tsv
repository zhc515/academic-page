Geometric Analysis Seminar			McGill University	2022-04-20	"Montreal, Canada"		"Title: Carleman type estimates and uniqueness of Cauchy problem\Abstract: Carleman estimate is a weighted estimate in proving the uniqueness of Cauchy problem. I will review some results and discuss an explicit example. In this example, we will see 1. How to get the estimate, 2. How to prove the uniqueness with this estimate."
Geometric Analysis Seminar			McGill University	2022-10-26	"Montreal, Canada"		"Title: From isometric embedding to a sum of squares theorem\Abstract: Motivated by an isometric embedding problem in the graph setting, we'll discuss a sum of squares theorem for Holder function. Given a non-negative C^{2,2\alpha} function f over R, can we find a function g in C^{1,\alpha} such that f=g^2? We've found a necessary and sufficient condition for this problem, which is related to the non-zero strict local minimum points of the function f."
